# airbnb-clone-project
The Airbnb Clone Project is a comprehensive, real-world application designed to simulate the development of a robust and scalable foundation for managing user interactions, property listings, payments and booking platform like Airbnb. It involves a deep dive into full-stack development, focusing on backend systems, database design, API development, and application security.

## Project Goals
- Create User,Property and Booking Management Review system with a Payment Processing and Data Optimization

##  Technology Stack 
- Django: A high-level Python web framework used for building the RESTful API.
- Django REST Framework: Provides tools for creating and managing RESTful APIs.
- PostgreSQL: A powerful relational database used for data storage
- GraphQL: Allows for flexible and efficient querying of data.
- Celery: For handling asynchronous tasks such as sending notifications or processing payments.
- Docker: Containerization tool for consistent development and deployment environments.
- CI/CD Pipelines: Automated pipelines for testing and deploying code change
  
## Team Roles 
- Backend Developer: Responsible for implementing API endpoints, database schemas, and business logic.
- Database Administrator: Manages database design, indexing, and optimizations.
- DevOps Engineer: Handles deployment, monitoring, and scaling of the backend services
- QA Engineer: Ensures the backend functionalities are thoroughly tested and meet quality standards.

## Database Design
### Key entities
1. User Management: Implement a secure system for user registration, authentication, and profile management.
2. Property Management: Develop features for property listing creation, updates, and retrieval.
3. Booking System: Create a booking mechanism for users to reserve properties and manage booking details.
4. Payment Processing: Integrate a payment system to handle transactions and record payment details.
5. Review System: Allow users to leave reviews and ratings for properties.
6. Data Optimization: Ensure efficient data retrieval and storage through database optimizations.
   
## Feature Breakdown
1. User Authentication
   - Features: Register new users, authenticate, and manage user profiles.
2. Property Management
   - Features: Create, update, retrieve, and delete property listings.
4. Booking System
   - Features: Make, update, and manage bookings, including check-in and check-out details.
6. Payment Processing
   - Features: Handle payment transactions related to bookings
8. Review System
   -  Post and manage reviews for properties.
9. Database Optimizations
    - Indexing: Implement indexes for fast retrieval of frequently accessed data.
    - Caching: Use caching strategies to reduce database load and improve performance.

## API Security
- Authentication
   - Ensures that only verified users and services can access the API.
   -  Implemented using secure protocols like OAuth 2.0 or JWT
   -  Prevents unauthorized users from accessing sensitive endpoints and data.
- Authorization
   -  Controls what authenticated users are allowed to do within the
   - Role-based access control (RBAC) or permission-based access policies.
   - : Protects resources by ensuring users only perform actions they are permitted to.
- Rate Limiting
   - Limits the number of API requests a user or IP can make in a given time period.
   -  Middleware like express-rate-limit (Node.js) or API gateways.
   -  Prevents abuse, brute-force attacks, and ensures fair usage for all users.
- Input Validation and Sanitization
   -  Validates and cleans user inputs before processing.
   -  Prevents injection attacks (e.g., SQL Injection, XSS).
- Logging and Monitoring
   - Tracks API usage and security events.
   -  Enables quick detection and response to security incidents.

## Why Security Is Crucial
- Protecting User Data
- Securing Payments
- Preventing Unauthorized Access
- Maintaining Trust and Reputation
- Ensuring System Stability
